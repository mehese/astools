Tools to use in manipulating structures

ReadWrite.py 
	structures -- defines the Atom and AtomStruct classes
	ReadStruct -- takes an output file or input file and returns and AtomStruct
	operations -- functions that modify a given AtomStruct
	analysis   -- functions that give some characteristics for the AtomStruct
                  like the RDF and such

TO DO:

	- maybe a more detailed neighbor analysis routine
